a game developed with python, this game has those features:
* accepts a search term on the command line 
* performs a search on wikipedia using that search term (e.g. "Harry Potter")
* takes the content of the top 5 pages returned by the search, and determines the most common adjectives across those pages
* draws a "ball" representing each of the top 6 adjectives
* allows the user to "pop" each balls by typing the first letter in the word contained in the ball
